# Complete the sequence_calculator function, which should
# Return the n-th number of the sequence S_n, defined as:
# S_n = 3*S_(n-1) - S_(n-2), with S_0 = 0 and S_1 = 1.
# Your implementation should minimize the execution time.
#
# (2)
# Find the time complexity of the proposed solution, using
# the "Big O" notation, and explain in detail why such
# complexity is obtained, for n ranging from 0 to at least
# 100000. HINT: you are dealing with very large numbers!
#
# (3)
# Plot the execution time VS n (again, for n ranging from 0
# to at least 100000).
#
# (4)
# Confirm that the empirically obtained time complexity curve
# from (3) matches the claimed time complexity from (2) (e.g.
# by using curve fitting techniques).
