This folder contains 2 Python files. Each Python file corresonds to an assignment.
Your goal is to complete the assignments and to return the files in a format that can be easily executed.

If you prefer to solve these assignments in a language that is not Python, it's totally ok to do so.
However, you'll have to rewrite the assigments in your preferred language and add instructions on how to execute the programs.

Note: Besides the correctness of the solutions, we will evaluate code style and clarity.

Good Luck!
